# TrusTerms

TrusTerms is an open-source browser extension designed to help users navigate and better understand online Terms of Service (ToS) agreements. With the rise of lengthy and complicated legal documents, many users unknowingly agree to abusive terms. TrusTerms aims to simplify this process by offering an easy way to evaluate and understand ToS agreements before signing them.

## Features

- **Real-time Notifications**: When visiting a sign-in page that requires agreeing to terms, TrusTerms notifies you about the presence of a Terms of Service agreement and helps you assess it.
  
- **Score Generation**: TrusTerms evaluates the terms based on predefined criteria and generates a score to indicate the level of risk or abusiveness.

- **Terms Summarization**: The extension summarizes the key points of the Terms of Service to help users quickly understand what they are agreeing to.

- **Chatbot Assistance**: A built-in chatbot allows users to ask specific questions about the Terms of Service and get concise, understandable answers.
